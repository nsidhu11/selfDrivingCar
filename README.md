# selfDrivingCar
This project creates a simulation for self driving cars. All work is done mannualy (without the use of any library) using Javascript. This 
project covers the basics of neural networks and its implementation using Javasript.

#Phases of project:

1.  Car Driving Mechanism:
2.  Road Definition:
3.  Artificial Sensors:
4.  Collision Detection:
5.  Traffic Simulation:
6.  Neural Networks:
7.  Visualizing Neural Networks:
